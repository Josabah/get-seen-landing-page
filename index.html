    <h1>Learn how to make your ideas land.</h1>

      A weekly newsletter on persuasion, clarity, and influence — for people
      who want their ideas to be seen, heard, and taken seriously.

    <p>
      Builders, thinkers, creators, and leaders often don’t struggle with what
      to say — but with how to say it so it’s understood, remembered, and acted on.
